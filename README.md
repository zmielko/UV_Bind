# Analysis and Data: "UV irradiation remodels the specificity landscape of transcription factors". 

This is the GitHub repo for the paper: "UV irradiation remodels the specificity landscape of transcription factors" which is currently in 
review with a preprint available at bioRxiv (doi: 10.1101/2022.10.07.511343). The repository contains the 
data and code used to generate the figures in the paper. 

### Repository Organization

The repository has 3 top level directories: Analysis, Data, and Design.

1. **Analysis**: Contains folders representing the analysis output used to create each figure and table (ex/ Figure_1, Table_S2) and a **Code**
folder containing the code for analysis.
2. **Data**: Contains the data used by the code in the **Analysis** directory.
3. **Design**: Contains array design information for UV-Bind sequences as well as the code and data used to design the UV-preferred k-mer arrays.
