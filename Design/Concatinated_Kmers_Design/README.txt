README: UV Array Design: TBP, MITF, EGR1, CREB1

Files:
- Array_Design_Full.txt: Array design in a format ready to submit to Agilent. 
- Array_Probes.txt: Probes used on the array without any replicates

Folders:
- Code: Contains the code used to generate the array design. 
- Data: Data used to generate probes. 
- Sequence_Designs: Design files in CSV format for probes

Code Folder: 
- affinityProp.py: Clusters probes using affinity propagation. 
- affinityPropParallel.sh: Shell script that runs affinityProp.py using GNU Parallel for 
   all probe files generated by differentialKmer.py
- differentialKmer.py: Generates probes based on k-mers preferred in UV conditions
- arrayDesign.ipynb: Creates the Array_Design_Full.txt and Array_Probes.txt files using
   the design files from Sequence_Designs and clustered probes from the differentialKmer.py
   and affinityProp.py output.


Sequence_Designs:
- 8x60k_UV_Array_Design.txt: Design file for the 8x60k UV Array. 
- Dinucleotide_Mutations.csv: List of sequences to generate dinucleotide mutations probes
 for.
- Probe_Position.csv: List of sequences to test binding site position on the probe.
- kD.csv: List of sequences used for kD calibration probes. 
- Flanks.csv: List of sequences to generate all possible 2-mer flanks on each side.
- Sequence_Designs_README: description for each sequence design file.

Data Folder: 
- Diff_UV_Probes: folder with generated probe output from differentialKmer.py and
   affinityProp.py
- EGR1_2_3: OLS data for EGR1
- TBP_28_29: OLS data for TBP
